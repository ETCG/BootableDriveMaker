# Usage
1. Mount the included DMG (double click it).
2. Either drag the application to your applications folder or move it to your Desktop or Documents folder.
3. Open the application.
4. Click the "Select An ISO" button.
5. Navigate through your files until you reach your downloaded Operating System ISO.
6. THIS STEP IS VERY IMPORTANT. Select the target drive in the dropdown list (the application selects the first attached external drive by default).
7. Click "Start". To stop the process at any time, click "Cancel" (this button will show up after you click start).
8. Wait for the drive to finish getting created (normally takes under 3 minutes, but changes with OS size).
9. Click "Quit" (this button will show up after the drive is done being created).

Congrats! Your drive should have been created.
